## README 

This model was developed in Python for the Economic Naturalist Assignment as part of Group-A-September-2025-Start's  Managerial Economics coursework at Imperial College London.

This simulation models multi-tier user dynamics, conversion, churn, and pricing elasticity for ChatGPT (2022–2035). It integrates a stochastic Monte Carlo framework (5,000 runs) with network effects and cost evolution. 
Output metrics include token throughput (TPM) distributions, annual revenue and profit trajectories under macroeconomic scenarios, and probability analysis for achieving milestone revenue thresholds (e.g., $100B by 2027).
